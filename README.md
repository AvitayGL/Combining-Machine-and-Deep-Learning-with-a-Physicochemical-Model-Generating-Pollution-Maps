# Machine Education Approach, Combining Machine and Deep Learning with a Physicochemical Model, Generating NO2 and PM2.5 Dense Pollution Maps in Israel

Accurate dense pollution maps constitute the first step toward better understanding and mitigating air pollution. However, sensing is mostly sparse. One of the common tools to cope with this challenge is physicochemical air pollution models. Many of these models, however, provide unsatisfactory performances, while also exhibiting inherent systematic biases. Here, a machine education approach is presented for the model’s inherent errors. The method utilizes Machine and Deep Learning (M&DL) algorithms as a method for bias correction, deployed on top of an existing physicochemical model, CHIMERE. Using real-life data, three error concealment models have been developed, a multilayer perceptron neural network, XGBoost and Random Forest. The neural network model exhibited the best performance among all models, followed closely by the XGBoost model, while the Random Forest model lagged. The results show that the M&DL models successfully mitigated model’s errors, conclusively, affirming the potential and effectiveness of the machine education approach.
